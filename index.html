    <h1>Hello Solar System</h1>

    <h2>A Few Facts About The Universe We Live In </h2>

    <p>Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

    <p>The solar system is the sun and everything that orbits around it. It includes the planets and their moons as well as numerous asteroids and comets. These objects are all held in orbit around the sun by the sun's strong gravity.</p>

    <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

      <h3>Why It Is Called The "Solar System" ? </h3>

      <p>There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is named the "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar." </p>
